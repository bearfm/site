# Introduction

When a man is stuck with cell service for a while (and abysmally slow LTE at that), he starts to realize how bloated the web is.
When slow dialup was common, people actually made their websites lightweight because it was the only option, otherwise the site wouldn't load for people trying to visit it.

# The Solution

The solution? Normalize web apps and websites that are easy on bandwidth (and your system for that matter).
The cozy web is full of these amazing sites, but the dark forest not so much.

Might need to write another chatting protocol...
